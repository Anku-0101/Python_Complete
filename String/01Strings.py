'''
String is a datatype in python. String is a sequence of characters enclosed in
quotes.
We can primarily write a string in these three ways
'''
#1. Single quoted strings --> a = 'Aman' , use this when double quotes is present in the string
#2. Double quoted strings --> a = "Aman" , use this when single quotes is present in the string
#3. Triple quoted strings --> a = '''Aman''', use this when both single and double quotes are in the string
